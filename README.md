# Websocket-ChatApp-SpringBoot

Chat application with Spring boot & WebSocket 

## Overview

The idea of the project was to learn a new communication protocol, in this case Websocket.

To do this, we built a one-on-one chat application that guarantees private and secure conversations. We will also persist these chats in a MongoDB database.

WebSocket is a real-time, bidirectional communication protocol that runs over a single TCP socket. It was designed to provide more efficient, low-latency communication between a web browser and a web server, although it can also be used in other contexts.
